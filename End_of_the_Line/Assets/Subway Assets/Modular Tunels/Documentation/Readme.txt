This tunnels are modular, you can snap them with unity vertex snapping tool.
There are 3 main kind of tunnels Tun01,Tun02 and Tun03. 
To connect Tun01 with tun02 find prefab named with "Tun01_ConTun02"- Con means connection.
To connect ton02 wuth tun03 use prefab named with "Tun02_ConTun03" and etc. for all tunnel connections..



I deleted Unity Standard Assets and Post Processing stack from package but to achieve same visual as in video please do next:

   Import Post Processing Stack from asset store and use "Modular Tunels"-file as Post-Processing Profile. 
   you can find it in the package under "PostProfile" folder.
   Modular Tunels\PostProfile\Modular Tunels
